	callevent chat_add_text say_hi "Greetings, young adventurer. What brings you here? I have knowledge of many things..." CHAT_DELAY talkright
	callevent chat_add_text say_hi "I can tell you of the [history], the [land], the [cities] and other places; and of the [Unbalance] that has recently reached our [temple]."

	callevent chat_add_text say_city "We are on the outskirts of Edana, the largest city in the Southeast. To the northeast is [Helena], on the borders of the plains of Daragoth." 6.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_city "Beyond those dangerous planes lies Deralia, the jewel of civilization and capital of the kingdom."
	callevent chat_add_text say_city "North of [Thornlands], past the nexus of [Bloodrose], lies the [Elven] city Kray Eldorad."
	callevent chat_add_text say_city "But troubles in the [Bloodrose] pass have made travel difficult, and thus sightings of [elves] are rare indeed."

	callevent chat_add_text say_bloodrose "Bloodrose lies beyond the [Thornlands], between the human lands, and those of the [elves]."
	callevent chat_add_text say_bloodrose "Strange troubles there have all but cut off the connections between our two peoples."

	callevent chat_add_text say_elves "The elves are the first of the Enlightened Races, most closely resembling the goddess who created them."
	callevent chat_add_text say_elves "They are a people of fierce honor, and wondrous majesty."

	callevent chat_add_text say_loreldians "The Loreldians, former keepers of this world, masters of a forbidden magic that nearly destroyed all that is."
	callevent chat_add_text say_loreldians "After the great Wars of Fate, only but a handful remained, and they vowed to banish themselves from this world."
	callevent chat_add_text say_loreldians "This, to save it from inevitable destruction at their own hands, for they had indeed become that powerful."
	callevent chat_add_text say_loreldians "Three were elected by [Pathos] to stay behind, and these are the great guardian gods we know today as The Triad:"
	callevent chat_add_text say_loreldians "[Felewyn] of Order, [Torkalath] of Chaos, and [Urdual] of Balance."

	callevent chat_add_text say_unbal "Recently, the [undead] have begun returning, plaguing the lands. Also, an alarming number of [orcs] have appeared."
	callevent chat_add_text say_unbal "These are all thought to be indications of a great imbalance, looming on the horizon."

	callevent chat_add_text say_pathos "The Golden God, the Shining One, the Guardian who awaits beyond The Gate of Dreams, many are the names of this most exalted, and most distant god of gods." 7.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_pathos "He has no temples, but each temple of The Triad has an aspect of Pathos within it, for it is He who chose our gods from among His people before leaving this world." 7.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_pathos "It is He who saved the world from the War of Fate through self-sacrifice and denial of His own desires and those of His own kin." 7.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_pathos "It is He who returned from The Beyond, for a time, to save us from destruction at the hands of the mad [Lor Malgoriand], ending the [Age of Blood]." 7.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_pathos "The Triad of gods he left to guard us complement one another and sustain the world. It is in His infinite wisdom that this diametric opposition was created." 7.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_pathos "For Pathos knew, while no [Loreldian] has within Himself the power to slay another, and it requires two to imprison a third..." 7.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_pathos "...it takes no less than three to destroy a forth forever."
	callevent chat_add_text say_pathos "Thus is the eternal reign of The Triad ensured, as is their eternal struggle, from which all progress is born."

	callevent chat_add_text say_temple "This temple is dedicated to Urdual, the venerable and wise deity of balance."
	callevent chat_add_text say_temple "Urdual's fate is to balance. Where there is too much order, he creates chaos. Where there is too much chaos, he creates order."
	callevent chat_add_text say_temple "It is he who forged the hearty Dwarves, who can live deep within the mountains, and thus separate themselves from the cycles of chaos and order."
	callevent chat_add_text say_temple "Do you wish to know [more] of the temple?"

	callevent chat_add_text say_temple_more "There's a reason for the somewhat 'unusual' way a temple of [Urdual] such as this is built."
	callevent chat_add_text say_temple_more "Each stone that forms this delicate structure has been blessed in another order's temple."
	callevent chat_add_text say_temple_more "The dark side of this temple is imbued with the strength of the god of chaos and freedom, [Torkalath]..."
	callevent chat_add_text say_temple_more "While the bright side is imbued with the power of order and law that emanates from [Felewyn's] shrines."
	callevent chat_add_text say_temple_more "The gold between them represents the founding power of [Pathos] which binds them together in common cause."
	callevent chat_add_text say_temple_more "It's a delicate balance. Would one side be slightly too weak or powerful, the entire temple may crack and crumble."
	callevent chat_add_text say_temple_more "If the power of chaos or order overwhelms an area, the nearby temples of [Urdual] often become asymmetric, and crack."
	callevent chat_add_text say_temple_more "Many such 'cracked' temples are scattered across the land..." 3.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_temple_more "Most are filled with monsters, bent on spawning yet more unbalance." 3.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_temple_more "Here, all is well enough, for now. But watch your step, for the paths of light and darkness are known to be a bit tricky."
	
	callevent chat_add_text say_history "Much of history is tainted by darkness, and amongst the darkest of these taints is the Lord Undamael."
	callevent chat_add_text say_history "The final abominable creation of [Lor Malgoriand], surviving even his master's defeat, he was eventually overcome by the power of a cabal of five powerful magi." 7.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_history "The army of [undead], which was under his command, has scattered. But some say the lord himself still lives on..."
	callevent chat_add_text say_history "It is said that it is he who causing the eternal night which has befallen the [forest] to the west."

	callevent chat_add_text say_forest "The forest to the west was once beautiful, but ever since the evil came, the place has been cursed."
	callevent chat_add_text say_forest "Now it is called Eswen Meldanual, meaning 'Forest of Midnight.'"
	
	callevent chat_add_text say_malgor "Ahh, Lor Malgoriand, as he was dubbed by the elves, litterally 'The Bringer of Darkness.'"
	callevent chat_add_text say_malgor "Hundreds of years ago he brought ruin and death to three quarters of the known world!"
	callevent chat_add_text say_malgor "If not for Lor Malgoriand, we would not have to deal with the [orcs] and mayhaps not even the [undead]."
	callevent chat_add_text say_malgor "Though he began as an [Apostle] of [Torkalath], tasked with restoring the balance, he had become infected with the madness of [The Lost]."
	callevent chat_add_text say_malgor "Though defeated by the [Apostles] after much bloodshed, his power and his minions still linger..."
	callevent chat_add_text say_malgor "...and there are many who believe he may one day return."

	callevent chat_add_text say_thelost "In times before man and dwarf and even elf, there were the Gods of Fate, known as [Loreldians], who banished themselves from this world."
	callevent chat_add_text say_thelost "But among these gods were those that refused to leave... Thus began the war of the gods, The Great War of Fate."
	callevent chat_add_text say_thelost "When the war concluded, those gods of hate and greed had their very existence stricken from all time and memory, and thus are forever known only as 'The Lost'." 7.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_thelost "But their power was such and their hate was so strong, that even with their souls shredded and scattered across the cosmos, the shadow of their evil remained." 7.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_thelost "That hate now infects the outermost edges of the very Threads of Fate, and is constantly searching for ways into our world."
	callevent chat_add_text say_thelost "Sometimes it succeeds and causes great disturbances, manifestations of pure violence and destruction. Mindless horrors beyond imagining." 7.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_thelost "Sometimes those truly lost in misery, hatred, or despair, find themselves possessed by the power of this ancient force."
	callevent chat_add_text say_thelost "Such was the case of [Lor Malgoriand], once a mighty [Apostle] of [Torakalath], he was seduced by the power of The Lost."
	callevent chat_add_text say_thelost "This was unbeknownst to all, until it was too late."

	callevent chat_add_text say_apostles "The Apostles are the warriors of Fate, patrons of the gods, their power drawn upon that of the [Loreldians] themselves."
	callevent chat_add_text say_apostles "None knows what became of those who helped defeat [Lor Malgoriand] at the close of the [Age of Blood]."
	callevent chat_add_text say_apostles "We only pray that they can be called upon once again when the need will arise, as there is no doubt it will."

	callevent chat_add_text say_rumor "Rumors? Well... I do know of one... Let me tell you a local story..."
	callevent chat_add_text say_rumor "Years ago, Deralia was ruled by a Tyrant-King. Only one man dared to challenge him: Kustrin, then mayor of Edana."
	callevent chat_add_text say_rumor "Kustrin was assassinated, which so infuriated his son that he went to Deralia to settle the score."
	callevent chat_add_text say_rumor "The king was arrogant, and not about to show fear of a little boy. He accepted the challenge to a duel."
	callevent chat_add_text say_rumor "What the king did not know was that the son had been studying swordplay all his life: thus the king was slain."
	callevent chat_add_text say_rumor "The boy's name?  You'll soon meet him if you haven't already.  But watch out, don't tread on his flowers!"

	callevent chat_add_text say_pq "Oh my, that ancient ring belonged to the legendary high priest Zahlon Erste."
	callevent chat_add_text say_pq "Xyphemox was his title name in the Order of Urdual." 3.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_pq "Legend has it that he was slain shortly after imprisoning the undead sorcerer [Shadahar]."
	callevent chat_add_text say_pq "It is foretold... That a fool of great power shall release [Shadahar] from his tomb."
	callevent chat_add_text say_pq "Thus marking the beginning of a great imbalance." 3.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_pq "Perhaps you are that fool?" 2.0 retina

	callevent chat_add_text say_allIknow "That is all I know on the subject, for I no longer venture beyond these halls."
	callevent chat_add_text say_allIknow "If there is more to discover, I'm afraid it is up to you to do so."

	callevent chat_add_text gave_ring "I suppose you are that fool after all." CHAT_DELAY idle4
	callevent chat_add_text gave_ring "The prophecy is clear, as is my duty, though I am loathed to perform it."
	callevent chat_add_text gave_ring "I shall restore the magic of this ring, and return it to you, as is ordained."
	callevent chat_add_text gave_ring "But woe is thee, for thou art the Ring Bearer, and harbinger of [Shadahar's] return." CHAT_DELAY gluonshow
	callevent chat_add_text gave_ring "Do with this ring as thou wilt, and I pray this evil shall yet be turned to good by your hand." CHAT_DELAY kneel

	callevent chat_add_text say_felewyn "Felewyn is the goddess of order and law. [Elves] worship her as their creator, save for those who serve [Torkalath] or [Urdual]."
	callevent chat_add_text say_felewyn "But those few are shunned, sometimes even hunted, by their more traditional kin."
	callevent chat_add_text say_felewyn "It is she who brought forth the herd animals and the hive-minded worker insects and other creatures of a calm and orderly nature in ages past..."
	callevent chat_add_text say_felewyn "She encourages those would uphold the law of the land over their own selfish desires, who protect the weak from the strong, and maintain discipline and order."

	callevent chat_add_text say_torkalath "Torkalath is the god of strength, of freedom, and of chaos. He believes in strengthening ones self through strife and struggle."
	callevent chat_add_text say_torkalath "He encourages those who defend their individuality, who resist conformity, and those who realize their fullest potential in whatever they may do."
	callevent chat_add_text say_torkalath "He created the great predatory beasts of the land during the recovery that followed the War of Fate, granting them strength, cunning, and grace."
	callevent chat_add_text say_torkalath "It is He who eventually forged the soul of man: ever striving and ever ambitious, flexible, adaptable, and clever."
	callevent chat_add_text say_torkalath "He gifted the [Orcs] to [Lor Malgoriand] at the beginning of the [Age of Blood], and created many of the other great warrior races that dot the lands."

	callevent chat_add_text say_urdual "Urdual is the god of balance." 3.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_urdual "The eldest of The Triad, His wisdom is sought after by the other two gods to determine the path of the ever-swinging pendulum of order and chaos."
	callevent chat_add_text say_urdual "[Torkalath] and [Felewyn] are at constant odds, and thus [Urdual] serves as the mediator between the two opposing forces of law and freedom."
	callevent chat_add_text say_urdual "After the War of Fate, it was He who established the never ending cycles of nature. May they endure eternally."
	callevent chat_add_text say_urdual "It is He who created the dwarven race, hearty and stoic, and as unshakable as the stones."
	callevent chat_add_text say_urdual "They dwell in the mountains that they may separate themselves from the constant conflicts of the lands. This allows them to play as impartial observers."
	callevent chat_add_text say_urdual "...Though it seems their quizzical nature rarely allows them to be exactly that."

	callevent chat_add_text say_aob "The Age of Blood of centuries past, describes the nearly two hundred year long war that ended The Crystal Eon of perfect order that came before it."
	callevent chat_add_text say_aob "It began at a time when order was so strong that all was stagnant, and they very freedom of thought itself was threatened!" 7.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_aob "But so violent was this war, that it broke beyond any new equilibrium, and into a terminal bloody chaos that threatened to engulf the world." 7.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_aob "[Lor Malgoriand], Torkalath's newest [Apostle], the strongest He had ever imbued with power, had been tasked with ending The Crystal Eon..." 7.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_aob "...but alas, he was mad with grief from the moment of his endowment."
	callevent chat_add_text say_aob "This made him vulnerable to the influence of [The Lost], and before even the gods themselves had known it, he was consumed by the harnessing of their power." 7.0
	callevent chat_add_text say_aob "It was for this reason that even when Torkalath revoked the power He had given His creation, [Lor Malgoriand] did not die."
	callevent chat_add_text say_aob "Instead, he grew only stronger, and more possessed of hatred."

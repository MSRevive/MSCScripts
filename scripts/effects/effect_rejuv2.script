//Rejuvenate2 by Thothie
//Any npc
//PARAM1 == hp to heal
//PARAM2 == Casters Divination Skill (unused thus far, but ideas be cookin)
//PARAM3 == Caster
//- The original rejuvinate method lagged the systme to hell and back
//- in addition, it became completely unbalanced once the ability to raise Divination skill was restored
//- finally the formula was too hard to predict
//- Thus we have this simple, one-shot meathod

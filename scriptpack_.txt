Finds all script files next to and in sub folders of the exe directory and compiles them into an sc.dll
(Maybe not exacly, would have to look at code to find exact behavior)

*Warning*
This running this program here will compile scripts from the scripts folder, and the scriptout folder once its
generated upon using !pack_release.
